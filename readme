TG_S0 = mesh refinement 

TG_S1/dV_TG_S1.sif = 2D grid data read-in, calculation of velocity gradient (dvu)

TG_S1p5/tempc_read.sif = 3D temperture read-in, bring forward 2D data read in previously and project to 3D

TG_S2/Simple2SR.sif = evidence that enhancement factor makes a large difference to ice tongue speeds. This results in relatively realistic ice tongue velocity, with speeds that increase over the time of the run. 

This sif assigns an enhancement factor based on the velocity gradient (dvu_ext), which is the recalculated dvu from TG_S1
after the projection through the medium in TG_S1p5 of vu and vx (proj_vu, proj_vx). 

TG_S2/Simple_TG_S3.sif = pre-steps to Simple2SR.sif. Not needed for running anymore.
