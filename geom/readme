Based on Rupert's PIGmeshGen pipeline
Taken from COLD GitHub repository on Oct 5 2020. 

Uses mmg tools through Elmer to refine the mesh.  The .geo file containing the boundary points has already been created elsewhere. For Thwaites this is in:
home/anna/Documents/Thwaites/3D_modelling/geometry/Thwaites/Thwaites_IMBIE_REMA/meshgen_local. Latest notes taken on Dec 1 2020 to prep csv and geo file. 


Done on local computer (Riegel)
Need to edit input.txt based on domain and conditions (Anna: what is input.txt for? I don't see it referenced in .sif or .lua files?)
Need to update *S0.sif based on inputs and conditions 
Need PIG and COLD .lua files with #meshin#, #meshout' set

To make mesh from .geo file:
gmsh -2 mesh2D_TG.geo -o mesh2D_TG.msh
ElmerGrid 14 2 mesh2D_TG.msh -autoclean (Anna: this means no partitioning at the moment)

[edit: copied this to mesh2D_PIG2_uniform]

To get mesh in .vtu format for checking:
ElmerGrid 14 5 mesh2D_TG.msh -autoclean

Using these netcdf files for ice thickness and observed velocity:
/Documents/Thwaites/velocity/Measuresv2/antarctica_m2slim.nc
/Documents/Thwaites/BedMachine/BedMachineAntarctica-2020-07-15.nc

Compile the local userfunction (actually not used after all!): (Anna: so don't do before trying w/o first)
elmerf90 USF_PCond.F90 -o USF_PCond.so

#Done on Mahti with *S0.sif
Then just run ElmerSolver in serial.  Refined mesh and .vtu files written to:
mesh2D_TG_refined


#Done on local computer (Reigel) with mesh2D_TG_refined.sh
ElmerGrid 2 2 mesh2D_TG_refined/ -metis 128  3 -partdual
#See ElmerGrid documentation. '3' refers to partitioning routine of Metis, METIS PartGraphKway
#partdual - The Metis algorithms that need a graph to work with by default use the nodal connectivity graph. As
an alternative choice the user may enforce the use of elemental connectivity graph, i.e. the dual graph.
This may be advantageous for the continuity of the partitions.
